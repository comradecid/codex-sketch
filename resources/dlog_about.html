				<h3>Set it up first</h3>
			
				<p>After installing the plugin, you'll need to first configure it for use. In the Sketch app menu, go to <i>Plugins</i> > <i>Codex</i> > <i>Preferences</i>; you should then see the Preferences dialog. The first, most important step is to sign in; without this, the style guide won't accept any of your changes. Click on <b>Sign in</b>, and enter your username and password.</p>
			
				<p>Next, you should take note of the <i>'Ignore items whose names begin with...'</i> section; these are settings for how to tell the plugin to 'ignore' specific items, so that no presentation changes to those items are sent to the style guide (even if you've selected them to be synced). Usually you won't have to change anything in this section. Close the Preferences dialog and your settings will be saved.</p>
